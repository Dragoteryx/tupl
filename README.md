# Tupl

This repository contains two crates:
- [tupl](https://crates.io/crates/tupl): A `#![no_std]` crate for handling Rust tuples using traits. It also provides traits to manipulate functions.
- [tupl-macros](https://crates.io/crates/tupl-macros): A crate providing the `impl_traits` macro used by the main `tupl` crate to implement the traits for tuples.
